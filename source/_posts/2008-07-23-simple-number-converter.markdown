I put together a simple AIR app in Flex for a co-worker the other day.  It's a simple panel that allows the user to enter a number in any form (binary, octal, decimal, hexadecimal) and it will display all of the other number types for you.  At first I didn't think it was all that useful.  But in a recent project I needed to double check that a value that I had entered as hex was correct.  When I traced out the value, the output window displayed it as a decimal number...  Hey, my little app came in handy!!!  I thought I'd make it available.

The icons were made using <a href="http://clockmaker.jp/labs/air_icon/">Clockmaker Icon Generator</a> another widget type AIR app.

One of the things I love about AIR and Flex is how quickly you can put together a simple little 'widget' type of app like this.  As I continue to learn more and more about the Flex framework, the more I'm liking it.

You can download the application using the install badge below.  (If you haven't seen it yet, you should check out <a href='http://www.peterelst.com/blog/2008/04/19/air-badge-wordpress-plugin/'>Peter Elst's AIR Badge WordPress plugin</a>)
