So day two was pretty interesting.  Jeffry Houser gave an interesting session on building Flex Components.  He has a comfortable, interactive style of speaking that works well, and keeps you involved with the session.

I really enjoyed the introduction to <a href='http://code.google.com/p/fluint/'> fluint</a>, the Flex Unit testing project by Jeff Taper.  Unit testing is one of those things that I would like to incorporate more into projects, but have always balked at the time considerations involved.  I think the fluint project is really come along.

I think my favorite session of the day was <a href='http://coenraets.org'>Christophe Coenraets</a> (Adobe Evangelist).  It was a pretty high level overview of LiveCycle Data Services, and using remote objects.  It didn't get into too much of the tech details, but I really enjoyed the session.  He also showed an interesting Flex portal application that was using Modules and a Module Loader.


After talking with Jeffry Houser for a few minutes, he talked me into doing an quick interview for the Flex Show.  I was really flattered to be a part of the show.  We mostly talked about the conference sessions and my thoughts on them.  I have been listening to the Flex Show for a while now, so it was nice to meet Jeffry, and be on the show.  You can check out the latest show, episode # 56 to hear it from <a href='http://www.theflexshow.com/blog/'>here</a>.

I ended up having to leave just before the mixer at the end to catch a cab to the airport.  I was disappointed at missing that.

All in all it was a great two day event.  I'm glad I went.  Thanks to 360 | Flex and the NJ Flex group for putting it together.
