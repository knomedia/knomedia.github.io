Capitan's log July 23, 2008

Getting the blog started today.  I should be working on a current freelance project, but I've wanted to get the blog started for some time now.  Plus I needed a break to let my brain chill out a bit.  I would post the usual junk about my intentions with the blog... blah blah blah.  As I come across issues, and more importantly solutions to flash / flex / actionscript development, I'll post them.  How about that?
