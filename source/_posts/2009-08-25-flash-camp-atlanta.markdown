A couple of things fell together for me in the last few days, and I started thinking about attending <a href="http://events.universalmind.com/page.cfm/flash-camp-atlanta-2009">Flash Camp Atlanta</a>.  I posted on twitter that I was trying to work things out to attend.  Turns out an email from David Tucker was just the motivation I needed, and I am officially going.  As part of that, I was asked to help out during the Introductory Session by giving a "Introduction To Flex" presentation.  There are some great speakers lined up for this camp.  You can see a listing of speakers and the schedule <a href="http://events.universalmind.com/page.cfm/flash-camp-atlanta-2009/schedule-1">here</a>.

I'm excited to be going to ATL.  The last Adobe event I attended there was the "On Air Bus Tour" a few years back.  My impression of the Flash / Flex community there has always been a good one, and based on some recent Twitter chatter it seems that there are over 200 tickets sold.  Should be a great event.  If you are in the area, or want to get away for a few days it looks like there are still <a href="http://flashcampatlanta.eventbrite.com/"> tickets available</a>.

See you there.
