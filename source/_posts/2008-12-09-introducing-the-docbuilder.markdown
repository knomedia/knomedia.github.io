I used it for a while, but shortly there after moved to Flex Builder as my editor.  At the University, the OOP course I teach, starts out in the Flash IDE for a few weeks, and then moves to using Flex Builder as an editor for ActionScript projects.

Lately I've just really dreaded the Flash editor.  I realize that it could come off as spoiled, but I really dislike typing out the usual skeleton code to get a class file started.  Tonight I decided that I'd had enough, so while the students were working on projects, I decided to update my extension.  I call it the DocBuilder.  It asks you for the package, class name, and what class you would like to extend.  It then asks you to save the file in the appropriate directory to match the package.  Viola!!!!  Stub code generated.

Here is a screen shot of the outputted class skeleton:

Feel free to download the extension from <a href='http://knomedia.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/docbuildermxp.zip'>here</a>.

<b>Update:</b> I found and fixed a small issue where the help button gave an error.  The linked file above is the latest version and seems to be working well.
