So it was bound to happen.  I put out a version of the <a href="http://knomedia.com/blog/?p=71">Badge Builder</a>, and Adobe and Grant Skinner soon there after release a similar application.

It is called Badger, it has a cool flying badger icon, and does a few really cool things.  For example when you select your AIR application it will pull your publisher ID, and application ID out of the AIR file itself.  Very nice touch.

While I haven't researched much further yet, it also appears that you can use various template badge SWF files.  Doing so should allow you to build your own custom template for use with the application.

You can check out Grant's post on Badger <a href="http://www.gskinner.com/blog/archives/2008/09/beware_the_air.html">here</a>
