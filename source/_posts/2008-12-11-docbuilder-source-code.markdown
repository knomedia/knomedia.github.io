I had a person or two ask about building Flash extensions and or want to modify the DocBuilder for their specific purpose.  In response I'm putting up the <a href='http://knomedia.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/docbuildersource.zip'>source files</a> for the DocBuilder as a reference to get people started.  Building Flash extensions in my experience involves creating a Flash interface, and using that Flash interface to execute JSFL (JavaScript for Flash) functions.  So you create a Flash interface, and then a JSFL file with functions that it will execute.  You then create an xml file that is used by the Extension Manager to build your extension.  Considering how simple it is, I'm surprised that there isn't an overwhelming amount of extensions talked about.
