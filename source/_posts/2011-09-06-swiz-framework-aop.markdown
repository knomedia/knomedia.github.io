<p>
The good folks behind the Swiz framework just dropped a nice little <a href="http://swizframework.org/">beta build of Swiz 2.0</a>. The beta release introduces Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP) into Swiz. I've only put together an initial proof of concept application that tests the waters, but am real excited about the work they have done. If you haven't done so already go check it out. Swiz is already a great framework, adding in AOP puts it over the top. Check out the intro to AOP article they have posted as well -- <a href="http://swizframework.org/post.cfm/introduction-to-aspect-oriented-programming-for-actionscript">Part 1</a>, and <a href="http://swizframework.org/post.cfm/getting-started-with-swiz-aop">Part 2</a>.

On September 8th at 6:00pm I'll be presenting on using Swiz for the <a href="http://fullsail.groups.adobe.com/">Full Sail Flash Platform User Group</a> (FSFPUG). If you are in Orlando, stop by (see <a href="http://fullsail.groups.adobe.com/">group site</a> for room details). If not be sure to check out the presentation online at: <a href="http://www.wddbs.com/go/fsfpug-connect">http://www.wddbs.com/go/fsfpug-connect</a>

Lastly, I've begun work on a screen cast series that introduces and overviews the features of Swiz. I'll post up information here when it's ready... stay tuned.
