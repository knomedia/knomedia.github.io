The presentation is entitled "Adobe AIR File I/O and Embedded SQLite".  I have posted a primer at the user groups <a href='http://adogo.us/2008/10/22/november-primer-adobe-air-file-io-and-embedded-sqlite/trackback/'>page</a>.  You can read the details there.  I'm hoping to cover both the technical details of the classes involved, as well as putting together examples.

If you are free on November 3rd, and in Orlando, come check it out.
