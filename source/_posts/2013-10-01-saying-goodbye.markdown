### Leaving and knowing that you'll miss it

I recently gave notice to terminmate my employment with the company at which
I've been employed (technically I've been a remote contractor for the last
year).  I've been there for 10 years, a long time when considered in the
context of today's tech world. I had a phone meeting today with the company's
director of software development. As we talked two things dawned on me:

1 I'm leaving for good reasons. Nothing gossipy or othewise worth posting. It
is just time for me to move on.

2 It's okay to recognize that it is time, and yet still feel a sense that I'll
miss it. I learned a lot during my time there. I made some good friends. I'll
miss working with 'em.

I think (for me anyway), it is easy to let today cloud the long term
perspective. I'm happy with where I am and where I'm heading today.
Yesterday's experiences, both good and bad, have helped me get where I am
today. So I'm coming to grips with the notion that it's time to leave, and
still know that I'll miss it.
