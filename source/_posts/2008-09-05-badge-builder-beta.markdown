<a href="http://knomedia.com/air/badgeBuilder"><img src="http://knomedia.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/badgebuilderbadge.png" alt="" title="Badge Builder" width="205" height="170" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-72" /></a>As mentioned in my previous post, I've been putting together an Adobe AIR application that allows the user to quickly create a Badge Install HTML file by filling out a simple form. The aim of <a href="http://knomedia.com/air/badgeBuilder">Badge Builder</a> is to give access to all of the options available for utilizing the Badge Installer, while not drowning the user with parameters that they don't wish to change.

You can toggle between the necessary, and optional parameters.  It has a built in preview function that will open your browser and display the HTML file.  Once you are satisfied with your settings, you simply build the file to the folder of your choice.  All of the fields have tool-tips to get you up to speed quickly on the information that is needed.  The application is just another way to be more productive.

I've set up a page with an Install Badge, screen shots, and a bit more by way of features <a href="http://knomedia.com/air/badgeBuilder">here</a>.

I have been testing it as I develop and use it.  So far is has been pretty stable for me.  If you find any issues, please let me know.
