So, later tonight I'll be speaking at the Adobe Developers of Greater Orlando (<a href='http://adogo.us/'>adogo</a>) user group on Adobe AIR.  We'll be looking into File I/O and SQLite as I had previously <a href-'http://knomedia.com/blog/?p=137'>mentioned</a>.  I thought I would post up the Slides as well as a few example flex projects that I will be go through in the presentation so that people can follow along on their own machine.  You can download the zipped materials <a href='http://knomedia.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/air_file_sqlite_examples.zip'>here</a>
