So I made it through day one of the 360 | Flex Camp today.  Yakov Fain from Farata Systems gave a one day "Advanced Intro To Flex" training at Montclair University in New Jersey.  It started with some pretty introductory topics, but it moved on quickly, and ended with some hands on use with BlazeDS.  I was excited to get a local installation of Tomcat and BlazeDS running on my Mac.  I have been using AMFPHP a lot on some of my latest projects.  We'll see how BlazeDS changes that for me in the future

Tomorrow features the guest speakers.  Several interesting topics on deck.

I can't end this post without thanking Danton Chin.  I was stranded at the University, and he offered me a lift to my hotel.  I would probably still be wandering around the University looking for an appropriate bus to catch right now if it had not been for his kind offer.
