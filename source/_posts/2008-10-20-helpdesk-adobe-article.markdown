I called it the HelpDesk.  I wrote the technical end of an article for Adobe about the application, how Flex was involved and other details.  I didn't realize that the article had gone live at Adobe's site until this morning when I got an email from a colleague who mentioned the article.  The app is described pretty thoroughly in the article so I won't go into details here.  The article is live at Adobe's site, you can check it out <a href='http://www.adobe.com/devnet/edu/articles/full-sail-flex.html'>here</a>.
