In so doing I sat in on two semesters of Java.  The courses were intended to teach both Java and object oriented programming.  Before I go too far, let me say that I'm comfortable with Java, in fact I actually enjoy Java.  Having said that, I will say that curriculum for beginning oop development should be, in my opinion, taught using ActionScript.  I realize that ActionScript isn't a perfect language.  There are some things that need to be addressed (The lack of an <a href='http://bugs.adobe.com/jira/browse/ASL-45'>Interface for the flash.display.DisplayObject</a> for example).  But taking it all in, the good and the bad, I think ActionScript is a really good language to learn with.  

ActionScript has all the usual strengths for beginning developers: strongly typed, compiled, object oriented, a vibrant and helpful community.  I feel that the biggest benefit for new developers is that most find it quite easy to create visual elements with ActionScript and Flash Player.  As such I think students get the added benefit of seeing their objects in action.  Having a relatively painless process that allows students to create visual objects helps students see the state of their objects.  It is a great system. It's the difference between calling a setter method and printing something to the console versus calling a setter and visually seeing your object update.

I have been teaching Object Oriented Programming using ActionScript for just over two years now.  I can't image having to do this in another language and getting students as far as I currently do.  You can argue for and against ActionScript and the Flash Player all day.  But it is a great language to cut your teeth on.  Lately I find myself more and more happy to be a Flash / Flex / ActionScript developer.
