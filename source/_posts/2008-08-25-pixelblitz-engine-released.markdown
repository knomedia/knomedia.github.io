Norm Soule has released v1.0 of his new <a href="http://www.normsoule.com/?p=59">PixelBlitz Engine</a>. It is a system for utilizing BitmapData to represent your MovieClips and Sprites.  There are several built in features (layers, pixel level collision detection, etc) but the most impressive reason for using it is the speed.  There are several demos, full documentation, and commented examples.  Definitely something to look at for highly interactive content, or game development.  As I get into it a bit deeper I will put together a more detailed review and an example or two.  At first glance this seems REALLY impressive.
