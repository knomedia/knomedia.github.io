<a href=""><img src="http://knomedia.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/tourdeflex.png" alt="Tour De Flex" title="Tour De Flex" width="128" height="128" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-130" /></a>So originally my work was planning on sending me (and a few others) to MAX NA 08, in San Fran.  Without sounding too bitter, they changed the plans on us.  So we are left in Orlando reading blog posts, and news updates from the sessions.  Hopefully Adobe will put the videos up on <a href='http://tv.adobe.com/'>Adobe TV</a> like they have been with some of the recent conferences.

Anyhow, in my readings about MAX, I have come across the <a href='http://flex.org/tour'>Tour De Flex</a> application that a few of the Adobe evangelists have put together.  It's an AIR application that gives you samples on using everything Flex, from the very basics, to some interesting third party components, and even some cloud API's.  It has working examples for everything.  A great application.  They even have a system in place to allow developers to showcase their own work through a submission process.  I can see this application being helpful for people just getting into Flex, or as a reference for Flex developers for those 'how does that component work again...' moments.

There is also an Eclipse plug in.  It allows you to search for components.  It will bring up a list of search results, double clicking the result opens Tour De Flex and displays examples, and descriptions.

I'm going to put the install badge in the widgets bar to the right for a while.  Feel free to install it directly from the badge, or visit the <a href='http://flex.org/tour'>Tour De Flex</a> page, where they have the same badge in effect.
