<p>I've been working with both <a href='http://swizframework.org/'>Swiz</a> and <a href='http://www.robotlegs.org/'>RobotLegs</a> a lot recently. While most of the talk behind Robotlegs is using the Mediator pattern, lately I've been trying to help a few folks understand the benefits of using the Presentation Model design pattern. According to the <a href='http://swizframework.jira.com/wiki/display/SWIZ/Presentation+Model'>Swiz Wiki</a>, it is the 'preferred' method for using Swiz. Before going too far... both the Robotlegs and Swiz communities are quick to point out that their preferred framework doesn't 'force' you to use their pattern. There is however a bias when you look over examples and best practices for each. I personally like the Presentation Model pattern. It feels clean to me. There are plenty of articles on the Presentation Model pattern out there. I thought I would attempt to put together my thoughts on how to implement the pattern within Flex.</p>
