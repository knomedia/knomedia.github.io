With the Flash / Flex community buzzing about <a href='http://www.forta.com/blog/index.cfm/2008/7/31/Adobe-And-Zend-Partnering-To-Give-PHP-Developers-Some-AMF-Love'>Adobe's partnering with the PHP Zend framework</a>, Lee Brimelow has put up two fantastic introductions to using <a href='http://www.amfphp.org/'>AMFPHP</a> within Flash at <a href='http://theflashblog.com/?p=418'>theFlashBlog.com</a>.  Both of the video screen cast are geared towards getting developers familiar with using AMFPHP, and as usual are quick, to the point, and efficient.  Absolutely worth a look.
