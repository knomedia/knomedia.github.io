I have gotten this question a few times over the last few weeks (we have several developers starting to explore ruby at work). I put together a video today on debugging ruby using <a href="https://github.com/pry/pry">pry</a> and <a href="https://github.com/nixme/pry-debugger">pry-debugger</a>. I thought I'd share it here as well.

I figure if nothing else, I'll have a place to point people should / when the question arises again.
