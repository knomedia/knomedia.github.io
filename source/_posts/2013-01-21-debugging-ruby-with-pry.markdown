I have gotten this question a few times over the last few weeks (we have
several developers starting to explore ruby at work). I put together a video
today on debugging ruby using <a href="https://github.com/pry/pry">pry</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/nixme/pry-debugger">pry-debugger</a>. I thought I'd
share it here as well.

I figure if nothing else, I'll have a place to point people should / when the
question arises again.
