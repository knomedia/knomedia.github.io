<p>I've been sharpening up the C++ lately. I have found it interesting that there does not seem to be a de-facto unit testing library. There are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unit_testing_frameworks#C.2B.2B">plenty of options</a> to choose from. I have decided to run with <a href="http://code.google.com/p/googletest/">Google Test</a> if for no other reason than it seems to be somewhat active and updated. I put together a quick pair of screen casts that walk through getting started with Google Test. I'm using a Mac running Lion (10.8.2) at this time, but believe these directions should be the same for most linux builds.</p>

<p>Enjoy</p>
