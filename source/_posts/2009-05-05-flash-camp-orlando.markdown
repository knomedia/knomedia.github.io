Universal Mind and Adobe have announced <a href='http://www.flashcamporlando.com'>Flash Camp Orlando</a>, a full day event happening May 29th.  I'm excited to have the mini conference here in my backyard.  Tickets are available for $50 and include entrance to the event, parking, lunch, and door prizes.  As I understand, the recent camp in Miami sold out, so go get your <a href='http://flashcamporlando.eventbrite.com/'>tickets</a> now.

The local Adobe User Group (Adogo) has a raffle for a few free tickets as well.  You can find more details at <a href='http://adogo.us/2009/05/04/may-meeting-canceled-flashcamp-orlando-ticket-raffle/'>this post</a> on the Adogo blog.

There is an impressive line-up of speakers including <a href='http://www.davidtucker.net/'>David Tucker</a>, <a href='http://www.infoaccelerator.net/'>Andrew Powell</a>, and Christian Saylor all from Universal Mind. As well as Greg Wilson from Adobe.

I'll be presenting "Making the Jump to Flex", an intro into migrating to the Flex Framework.  Over the next few weeks my hope to is post a few brief articles aimed at getting up to speed with the basics of the Flex Framework.
