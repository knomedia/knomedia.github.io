We are about half way through <a href="http://www.flashcamporlando.com">Flash Camp Orlando</a>. This mornings keynote was given by <a href="http://gregsramblings.com/">Greg Wilson</a> who showcased the latest Flash Catalyst and Flash Builder builds.  Pretty cool looking stuff.  I am looking forward to getting into both of those apps.

I gave my presentation, "Making the jump to Flex".  I didn't quite get a chance to show all of my examples, but as promised, <a href="http://knomedia.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/makingthejumptoflex1.zip">here</a> are my slides in .pdf form and Flex Builder project archives.  The flex examples are pretty basic, but if you are just getting started with Flex, maybe you will find them helpful.  I'm also posting the actual <a href="http://knomedia.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/FCO_MakingTheJumpToFlex.key.zip">keynote slides </a> ( as in .key, not .pdf ) the keynote is a bit large (17MB).

<a href="http://www.davidtucker.net/">David Tucker's</a> presentation on AIR data persistence was great.  We're just now getting started with Carl Smith covering user experience.

So far so good.  I'm digging the Flash Camp Orlando.
