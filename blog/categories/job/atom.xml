<p>I recently gave notice to terminmate my employment with the company at which
I&rsquo;ve been employed (technically I&rsquo;ve been a remote contractor for the last
year).  I&rsquo;ve been there for 10 years, a long time when considered in the
context of today&rsquo;s tech world. I had a phone meeting today with the company&rsquo;s
director of software development. As we talked two things dawned on me:</p>

<p>1 I&rsquo;m leaving for good reasons. Nothing gossipy or othewise worth posting. It
is just time for me to move on.</p>

<p>2 It&rsquo;s okay to recognize that it is time, and yet still feel a sense that I&rsquo;ll
miss it. I learned a lot during my time there. I made some good friends. I&rsquo;ll
miss working with &lsquo;em.</p>

<p>I think (for me anyway), it is easy to let today cloud the long term
perspective. I&rsquo;m happy with where I am and where I&rsquo;m heading today.
Yesterday&rsquo;s experiences, both good and bad, have helped me get where I am
today. So I&rsquo;m coming to grips with notion that it&rsquo;s time to leave, and stil
know that I&rsquo;ll miss it.</p>
